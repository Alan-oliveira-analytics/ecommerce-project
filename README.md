# ecommerce-project
This project uses a Kaggle database from a UK-based e-commerce platform with one year of sales transactions. The dataset contains 500,000 rows and 8 columns. The primary goal is to answer the following questions:

1. How was the sales trend over the months?
2. What are the most frequently purchased products?
3. How many products does the customer purchase in each transaction?
4. What are the most profitable segment customers?
5. Based on your findings, what strategy could you recommend to the business to gain more profit?
